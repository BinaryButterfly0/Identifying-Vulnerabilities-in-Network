# Basic Network Security Lab


This repo documents a hands-on lab for performing a basic network security assessment (host discovery, port/service scanning, traffic capture, vulnerability scanning, web assessment, and controlled exploitation) in an isolated VMware environment.


**Topology**
- VMware Host-only network (VMnet1)
- Ubuntu Server (target): `192.168.154.0/24`
- Kali Linux (attacker): ``


**Tools used**: nmap and wireshark (tcpdump)

See `LAB_PLAN.md` for the detailed step-by-step lab plan and `lab_prep_and_scan.sh` to auto-install tools and run basic nmap scans.

### Overall Conclusion

These exercises provided hands-on experience in basic network security assessment:

## Exercise 1 taught host discovery and port scanning to identify potential entry points.

## Exercise 2 focused on traffic analysis to detect anomalies and suspicious behavior.

Together, these labs strengthen understanding of network vulnerabilities, monitoring techniques, and prepare for more advanced security assessments.
